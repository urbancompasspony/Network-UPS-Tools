Testing NUT
There are three different layers of testing you can do, to verify NUT is running correctly.

NOTE: These options could result in data loss! Make sure you're not doing any critical activities on the systems while you're testing your power setup...

1 - NUT Debug / test mode
I... never tried this, but apparently you can do a 'soft test' following the instructions in Dan Langille's blog: nut â€“ testing the shutdown mechanism

2 - Live test of NUT without unplugging NAS
You can trigger the fsd event manually on the NUT Pi server with:

upsmon -c fsd
That will immediately emulate the condition of the UPS status OB LB (On Battery / Low Battery), which tells all connected systems to run their shutdown command.

3 - Live end-to-end test with UPS on battery
Unplug your UPS. Monitor the stats with upsc (like upsc server-room-rack, for mine), and validate the various parameters are correct for your NAS.

Wait a while, and keep an eye on metrics like:

$ upsc server-room-rack
battery.charge: 32
...
battery.voltage: 51.30
...
ups.load: 11
...
ups.status: OL
At some point, the UPS will have a status like OL LB or ALARM OB, and NUT should trigger shutdowns on all your connected NUT clients.
